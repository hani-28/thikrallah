    <string name="help">        &lt;b&gt;How do I play audio?&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;Open any Quran page. Tap on the screen once. At the bottom, you will notice
        a play button and some text with the name of a qari. Click the name of the qari to
        choose a different qari. Click play to download and play the current page or sura.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I view translation?&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;Open any Quran page. Tap on the screen once. In the top, you will notice a
        globe icon (or, if you don\'t see it, click an icon with three square dots) - click
        this and choose translation to view the translation.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        If you do not have any translations downloaded, it will take
        you to a screen where you can download translations. Choose and download a translation,
        then return back and tap the globe icon again to view the translation.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I bookmark a page?&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;Open any Quran page. Tap on the screen once. In the top right, you will see a
        bookmark icon. Tap the bookmark icon to bookmark the page (the color will turn solid white). Tap the bookmark icon
        again to remove the bookmark.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I make the text larger?&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;For the Arabic pages, hold your phone in landscape. This makes the text larger.
        For translations, go to settings and set translation text size.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I share an ayah?&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;While on any Arabic page, press and hold on any ayah to get a menu where you can
        choose to bookmark, tag, share or copy that ayah to the clipboard, see the translation,
        or listen to its recitation.&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malayalam/Tamil/Bengali/Urdu fonts don\'t work!&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, Android versions prior to 4.0 do not support these fonts, and there is
        little we can do to help with this.
